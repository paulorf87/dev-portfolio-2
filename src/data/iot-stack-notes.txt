Things: Sensors and actuators. 
Sensors are devices used to measure a physical property (e.g. temperature, 
distance, position, etc) and convert it into an output signal. 
Actuators, on the other hand, are responsible for controlling a mechanism or 
system through action/movement (e.g. motors, valves, cylinders, etc). 

Communications Network: Responsible for the data transfer between the things 
and application. There are 4 subdivisions to this layer:
1 Access sublayer: responsible for the last connection, or “last-mile network”, 
between nodes (sensors and actuators) and the network backhaul. Power restrictions
of many devices, which can be battery operated, make technologies with low energy 
consumption and low throughput a very popular choice for this sublayer, 
such as Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE), for short distances, to LoRa (Long Range) 
for distances in a scale of kilometres. 


2 Gateways and Backhaul: Here is where the bulk of data, coming from many devices 
and gateways, merge and flows before going over the Internet. 
Therefore, technologies with higher data throughput of data necessary 
in this stage. For example, Ethernet (wired) can be used as backhaul 
in layouts where changes are not constant such as factories and oil rigs, 
whereas WiFi (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz) can be used in mining operations.

3 Network Transport: This layer is responsible for the transference of 
data packets between client/server via TCP or UDP protocols. 

4 IoT Management:  This layer concerns the protocols of data transmission 
between the devices and other IoT systems. The main protocol used for this 
communication is MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry). 

Application: Where the data is finally transformed into information by some 
application, which can trigger actions or used in the decision making process.
